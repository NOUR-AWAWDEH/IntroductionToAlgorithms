# The Role of Algorithms in Computing : 

## What is An algorithm?
 - An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a finite amount of time.

 - An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

 - An algorithm as a tool for solving a well-speciûed computational problem.

---

 - A correct algorithm solves the given computational problem.

 - An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer.

## what is A data structure ? 

 - **A data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications. 
 
 - Using the appropriate data structure or structures is an important part of algorithm design.
 
 - No single data structure works well for all purposes, and so you should know the strengths and limitations of several of them.

## What is efficiency ?
 
 - how long does an algorithm take to produce its result ? 
In computational complexity theory, a problem is NP-complete when:

## What is a  decision problem ?

 - A decision problem, meaning that for any input to the problem, the output is either "yes" or "no".

 - When the answer is "yes", this can be demonstrated through the existence of a short (polynomial length) solution.

 - The correctness of each solution can be verified quickly (namely, in polynomial time) and a brute-force search algorithm can find a solution by trying all possible solutions.

 - The problem can be used to simulate every other problem for which we can verify quickly that a solution is correct. 

 - In this sense, NP-complete problems are the hardest of the problems to which solutions can be verified quickly. 

 - If we could find solutions of some NP-complete problem quickly, we could quickly find the solutions of every other problem to which a given solution can be easily verified.

### What is Polynomial Time?

Polynomial time is a concept used in computer science to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of how its running time grows with the size of the input. Let's break it down step-by-step.

#### Turing Machine as a Model

1. **Turing Machine**: Imagine a Turing machine, which is a theoretical model for computation. It's like a very basic computer that performs operations step by step.
2. **Input Size**: When you give the Turing machine an input, its size is denoted by $n$ . The size could be the length of a string, the number of elements in an array, etc.

#### Computation Sequence

3. **Configurations**: As the Turing machine processes the input, it goes through a sequence of configurations (states) at each step. These configurations can be represented as $'c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots'$.
4. **Finite Computation**: Ideally, the machine will eventually stop after a finite number of steps. If it stops after $ t $ steps, then $ t $ represents the running time for that input of size $ n $.

#### Polynomial Time Definition

5. **Polynomial Running Time**: An algorithm is said to have polynomial running time if there exist constants $ k $ and $ C $ such that the running time $ t $ is at most $ Cn^k $. This means the time it takes to complete the computation grows at most like some polynomial function of $ n $.
6. **Big-O Notation**: In Big-O notation, we express this as $ O(n^k) $. This includes:
   - **Linear Time**: $ O(n) $
   - **Quadratic Time**: $ O(n^2) $
   - **Cubic Time**: $ O(n^3) $
   - And so on...

#### Non-Polynomial Time

7. **Exponential Running Time**: Algorithms that have running times like $( 2^n )$ or $( 3^n )$ grow much faster than polynomial time and are not considered efficient for large inputs.

8. **Sub-Exponential Time**: Some algorithms, such as the best-known algorithm for factoring large numbers, have running times like $O(\exp(Cn^{1/3} \log^{2/3} n))$. This is called sub-exponential time.

9. **Quasi-Polynomial Time**: Other algorithms might run in time like $O(\exp(A\log^C n))$, where $ A > 0 $ and $ C > 1 $. These are known as quasi-polynomial times. Recently, such algorithms have been found for certain complex problems like discrete logarithms over small characteristics.

### Summary

- **Polynomial Time**: An algorithm runs in polynomial time if its running time $ t(n) $ is at most $O(n^k)$ for some $ k $.

- **Non-Polynomial Time**: Algorithms with running times like $ 2^n $ are considered inefficient for large inputs.
- **Intermediate Times**: Sub-exponential and quasi-polynomial times lie between polynomial and exponential times in terms of growth rate.

- This concept is crucial in computer science because polynomial-time algorithms are generally considered efficient and feasible for practical use.

## Algorithms and other technologies

you should consider algorithms, like computer hardware, as a technology.

Total system performance depends on choosing efûcient
algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware.
